                Hello, I'm Kseniia
                <br>
                I'm a VFX Supervisor
                <br>
            </h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I’m Kseniia Ivanova, a VFX Supervisor with over 10 years of experience in the industry,
                    currently working with incredible InSoul Effects.
                    I started as a Roto artist at Moscow, and over 10 Years
                    I worked my way through every discipline I could get my hands on as an artist, Lead and eventually VFX Supervisor!
                    As professional I traveled around the world and was lucky to spend deadlines in Canada,Australia and Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold master degree in directing and love every aspect of the Film and TV making process, especially getting to work with like minded and creative directors, producers and artists!
                    I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and growing as a creative. That's why I run the VFX Larek channel (one man vfx operation),
                    where I share my experience while creating personal projects, the pipeline tips and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I engage in activities related to classical art, such as drawing and photography. Recently, I have also been
                    exploring the field of machine learning and computer science in general. I have a pretty diverse Portfolio with a mixture of huge movies
                    with hundreds of VFX Shots, to smaller indie films with invisible VFX, multiple coding language skills like C, Python, JavaScript
                    and more. Take a look on the Reel’s and Breakdown’s page for an in-depth look at my work and the portfolio page for a full list of my
                    skills.
